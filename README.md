# Mathnasium-Auto-Reminder
A terminal based GUI that uses a headless version selenium to send text messages to parents. The message is usually about a student being late/not showing up.

# The task
Automatically send messages to the parents of kids that are late to their Mathnasium tutoring session.

# Why is this important?
Sometimes there are a lot of students that are late or do not show up to their online or in person tutoring session.
Identifying the phone number of the parent and then texting them could take some time.
Making a system that can easily text parents with a few clicks of a button will save a lot of time.

# Problem!
How was I going to make a system to easily text our student's parents?

# Solution
Using the [Textfree.us](https://textfree.us/) service I was able to use a headless version of https://www.selenium.dev/
